INTRODUCTION
The advent of digital communication has revolutionized the way we connect with others, transcending geographical boundaries and time zones. Chat applications have become an essential part of our daily lives, enabling us to instantly exchange messages and stay connected with friends, family, and colleagues. However, text-based communication sometimes falls short in capturing the richness and nuances of face-to-face interactions. To address this limitation, integrating video call functionality into chat applications has emerged as a compelling solution.
This paper introduces a chat application with integrated video call features, aiming to enhance the user experience by enabling real-time video communication alongside instant messaging. The application leverages cutting-edge technologies, such as ZEGOCLOUD, which enables peer-to-peer audio and video communication in web and mobile applications.
The primary goal of the chat app is to provide users with a seamless and intuitive platform to connect, chat, and engage in face-to-face video calls with their contacts. Users can create personal accounts, build their contact lists, and initiate private or group chats. The video call feature allows users to establish high-quality video calls, leveraging the device's camera and microphone. They can switch between front and rear cameras, mute or unmute audio, and toggle video streaming as per their preference.
Security and privacy are paramount in the design of this chat app. End-to-end encryption is employed to ensure that all chat messages and video calls are secure and only accessible to the intended recipients. User data is handled with utmost confidentiality, and stringent measures are implemented to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.
